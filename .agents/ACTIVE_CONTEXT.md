# Active Context: Pitch Analytix Pro

This file defines the system objectives, feature backlog catalog, active technical approach, and verification methods.

---

## 🎯 System Objectives
*   **Active Phase**: Shot Detection Reliability — Random Forest Integration
*   **High-Level Vision**: Pitch Analytix Pro is a professional-grade cricket training companion utilizing Wear OS IMU sensors, local kinematics heuristics, mobile dashboards, and cloud transcription pipelines.
*   **"The Digital Pavilion" UI Spec**:
    *   **Background**: `#000000` (True Black for OLED screen battery conservation) / `#001B3D` (Deep Navy accents).
    *   **Primary Color**: `#58FF63` (Neon Green - High visibility, active tracking status).
    *   **Secondary Color**: `#BCD2FE` (Light Blue - Secondary metrics and averages).
    *   **Typography**: `Space Grotesk` (Modern, geometric, glanceable).
    *   **Roundness**: `Round Four` (Circular watch-optimized shapes).

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
*   **Wear OS Smartwatch**: Runs a foreground tracking service (`TrackerService`) with a partial wake lock to guarantee continuous 50Hz sensor logging. Rotates raw sensor vectors using quaternions and computes real-time metrics locally using `SwingDetector`. When raw logging is enabled (diagnostics mode), it dynamically registers and logs the full watch sensor stack (up to 15 standard Wear OS physical and virtual sensors) to CSV files using a dedicated background thread (`SensorLoggingThread`) to prevent system lag.
*   **Companion Android App**: Uses a Room SQLite database for offline storage. Receives timeline data packages via Google Play Services Wearable Data Layer API. Integrates exercise sessions into Samsung/Google Health Connect under the "Cricket" type.
*   **Python Automation Pipeline**: ADB automation (`automate_pipeline.py`) pulls sensor logs and phone audio, computes clock offsets automatically using the phone audio's filename and watch's `SYSTEM_START` timestamp (falling back to a 5-tap gyroscope/audio signature), calls the Gemini API (`gemini-3.5-flash`) for time-coded transcriptions, and segments sensor data into 6-second windowed CSV files for model training.

## 🔖 Current Session State (session-2026-06-07_14-34-24)
*   **Session Directory**: `/Users/neilkloot/Code/Batting Sensor Stats/live_watch_sessions/session-2026-06-07_14-34-24`
*   **Audio File**: `narration_20260607_143423.m4a`
*   **Status**: Successfully integrated the 10-feature transpiled Random Forest model into SwingDetector Kotlin logic and retired all hardcoded decision tree rules/overrides. Created mathematical parity test and verified 100% mathematical parity. Aligned real-time feature extraction windows with Python training parameters and added magnetometer loading/routing and non-swing event filtering to the GroundTruthTest scorecard harness. Verified that all 11 unit tests pass and physical live session classification accuracy achieves 74%–96%, matching offline expectations.
*   **Previous Session (session-2026-06-05_12-29-59)**: Evaluated k=2 (3-of-4) stance gate and Variant 6 classification overrides.

## 🧪 Verification & Testing

### 1. Automated Verification
*   **Kinematics Unit Tests**: Run `SwingDetectorTest` to verify math helpers, ring buffer logic, and state transitions.
*   **Ground Truth Scorecard**: Run [SwingDetectorGroundTruthTest.kt](file:///Users/neilkloot/Code/CricketBattingTracker/wear/src/test/java/com/mrpeel/cricketbattingtracker/ml/SwingDetectorGroundTruthTest.kt) to generate the performance scorecard against physical batting session datasets.

### 2. Manual E2E Simulation
*   **Launch Emulators**: Run `./start_emulators.sh` to boot Phone and Wear AVD targets.
*   **Visible E2E Script**: Execute `./run_visible_e2e.sh` to compile, deploy both apps, simulate shots, and verify synchronization.

### 3. Live Session Verification
*   Deploy `wear` debug APK to physical watch: `./deploy_physical.sh`
*   Record a session with `ENABLE_RAW_LOGGING=true` to get all 7 CSV files including `WatchGameOrientation.csv` and `WatchSteps.csv`
*   Run `automate_pipeline.py` and compare detection count to narrated shot count
